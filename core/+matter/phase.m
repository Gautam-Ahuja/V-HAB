    %PHASE Phase with isotropic properties (abstract class)
    %   This class represents a matter phase with homogeneous mass
    %   distribution and thus isotropic properties. It is not meant to be
    %   used directly, use e.g. |matter.phases.gas| instead.
    %
    %TODO: rename to |IsotropicPhase| or |HomogeneousPhase|
    %
    %TODO: refactor some of this code out to a new |Mass| class and inherit
    %      from it??
    %
    %TODO (further ideas)
    %   * conduct (mass)update calculations for all phases scheduled for
    %     current tick in a single post-tick (before solvers/timesteps)
    %     callback simultaneously
    %   * manipulators for volume - package matter.manips.volume, different
    %     base classes for isobaric, isochoric etc. volume changes
    %     -> how to handle the store (which distributes the volume equally
    %        throughout gas phases)? How to treat volume changes due to
    %        inflowing matter?
    %   * method .setHeatSource(oHeatSource), see thermal solver
    %   * post-tick priorities / execution groups: separate update of flow
    %     p2ps and manips - first post-tick callback - from the time step
    %     calculation - second post-tick callback. In post tick, first
    %     exec phase properties update methods (mass, molar mass etc), then
    %     the solver flow rates. Then the phase manips/p2ps can update and
    %     finally the phases can calculate their time steps. Each p2p/manip
    %     should add itself to post-tick - if already done, not done again.
