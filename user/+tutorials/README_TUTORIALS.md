Tutorials
==============

To run one of the tutorials, enter the following command into the MATLAB command window: For example the `simple_flow` tutorial is `vhab.exec('tutorials.simple_flow.setup');`. Once the simulation has completed (you will see this by the outputs in the command window), you can plot the results of your simulation by entering `oLastSimObj.plot()` in the command window. Now you can play around with some of the parameters of the systems inside the tutorial and see what happens.
