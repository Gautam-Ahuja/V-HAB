User directory
==============

All functionalities and simulations by users go here. Classes and functions have to be created in the according project directory within the users own directory.

If user 'some_user' creates a project 'my_project' in GITlab, the according directory in here would be '+some_user/+my_project'. Only classes and functions can be put in there.

To execute the simulation, go to the main bootstrapping directory, make a copy of the main.m, rename it to e.g. main_some_user_my_project.m and update it to use your classes, e.g. some_user.some_project.NewSystem(...).
