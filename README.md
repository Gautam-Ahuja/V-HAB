V-HAB / STEPS Bootstrapping Package
-----------------------------------

Downloaded from GitLab at <https://gitlab.lrz.de/steps/STEPS-base>

Bootstrapping Repository
------------------------

Basic repository with the framework for V-HAB / STEPS. Contains four directories:

* core: central, shared V-HAB framework.
* lib: helper functions, pre/post processing, logging, GUI, date functions, ... (TBD)
* user: user-specific simulations
* data: user-generated simulation results (e.g. logs, plots, spreadsheets)

The core and lib packages are managed, i.e. most likely no changes should be done or can be committed to the online repository. Wiki of the according projects will soon contain some help.

How to get started with programming for V-HAB
------------------------------------
After you have the code and your user project you can go to the [introduction chapter](https://wiki.tum.de/display/vhab/3.+Introduction+to+V-HAB) for V-HAB and read it. You should also have a look at the [coding guidelines](https://wiki.tum.de/display/vhab/4.+Coding+Guidelines+in+V-HAB) to avoid having your advisor tell you to do stuff differently after you have programmed everything!
